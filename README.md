# hello-world

Hello world!
I look forward to learning as much as I can in the world of web-development/software-development.
My interest for writing code started early on in the late-90s, as a kid. Now, as an adult, 
I am pursuing a goal of becoming a web-developer (full-stack). After I master that I am going to pursue
software-development. 

Like a phoenix rising from the ashes I aim to someday leave my current dead-end job. Rising towards a new career
and a new me.
